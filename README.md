# Welcome to the Mortgage Calculator 🏡

Hey there! If you're looking to understand the nitty-gritty of your mortgage loan, you've come to the right place. I've put together this simple Python script that'll break down the numbers for you. Don't worry, you don't need to be a tech wizard to use it. Just follow the steps below, and you'll have all the info you need in no time!

## How to Use

1. First off, go ahead and download the script to your computer.
2. Next, open up your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder where you've downloaded the script.
4. Now, type in the following command and hit enter:
    ```
    python cli-mortgagecalculator.py
    ```
5. The script will ask you to enter the principal amount of the loan, annual interest rate, and number of years for the loan. Just type in the numbers and press enter.
6. And voilà! The script will work its magic and calculate your monthly payment, total interest paid, and the total amount you'll have paid by the end of the loan term.

## What You'll Get

Here's what you can expect the script to spit out:

1. **Monthly Payment:** This is how much you'll be paying every month.
2. **Total Interest Paid:** This is the grand total of all the interest you'll be paying over the life of the loan.
3. **Total Amount Paid:** This is the whole shebang – the total amount you'll have forked over by the time the loan is paid off, including both principal and interest.

## Just a Friendly Reminder

Keep in mind that this script is just a tool to help you wrap your head around your mortgage.

Happy house hunting! 🏡🏡🏡
